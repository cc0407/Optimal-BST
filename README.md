# Optimal-BST
Reads in a file of words, creates an optimal binary search tree (BST) for the words, and searches the trees. For each word, the program generates a probability of occurence based on the number of repetitions in the file.

## Compilation Instructions
- navigate to the directory that contains the makefile
- run `make`
- This will create `./q1`

## Runtime Instructions
The **filename** is **hardcoded** as `data_A4_Q1.txt`  
Please insure that the filename for testing is the same.

### For Q1:
- Run `./q1 1` for optimal BST using dynamic programming
- Run `./q1 2` for optimal BST using a greedy technique
